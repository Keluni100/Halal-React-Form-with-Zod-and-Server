Modern Form with gender specific sign up requirements. Sign up for Nikkah Guard.

Overview of Enhancements
This project began with a foundational React form utilising React Hook Form and Zod validation. The primary objective was to transform this generic template into a specialised, production-ready registration system for a niche matrimonial application. The core purpose was to create distinct, culturally-sensitive user experiences for male and female applicants while enforcing strict data integrity and validation rules specific to the application's domain.

Technical Implementation and Domain Adaptations
To achieve a gender-specific flow, I significantly extended the original Zod validation schemas. I introduced new, required fields for guardian contact information—mehramEmail and mehramPhone—which are critical for the application's cultural context. These fields incorporate the same rigorous validation as the primary user's contact details, using complex regular expressions to ensure international phone number formats and valid email structures. This design intentionally supports scenarios where multiple siblings may register under the same guardian, moving beyond a simplistic one-to-one model. Furthermore, I established a complete end-to-end type-safe validation pipeline. The same Zod schema is utilised on both the client and the server within the Next.js API route, guaranteeing absolute consistency in validation rules. This architecture prevents data drift and enhances security by re-validating all submissions on the backend, with server-side errors being precisely mapped back to their corresponding form fields to provide clear user feedback.

User Interface and Experience Refinements
The user interface was completely redesigned to provide a more modern, engaging, and thematic experience. I implemented a custom Tailwind CSS layout featuring unique graphical patterns, such as hexagonal motifs for the female registration form, with plans to apply distinct visual themes for the male form. This thematic differentiation extends to the content, where gender-specific religious quotations and instructive paragraphs are embedded to resonate with the respective users. While creating these unique identities, I maintained a reusable and consistent design system through shared Tailwind CSS utility classes for core components like inputs, cards, and buttons. This ensures visual coherence across the application while allowing for targeted stylistic variations.

Outcome and Architectural Integrity
These collective improvements result in a robust, domain-aware application feature. The form now successfully balances stringent technical validation requirements with a nuanced understanding of its specific user base. The architecture promotes maintainability through a clear separation of concerns: type definitions and schemas are centralised, validation logic is decoupled from presentation, and the styling system supports both consistency and customisation. The final product is a significant evolution from a basic tutorial form into a sophisticated, purpose-built module that addresses real-world functional, cultural, and user experience requirements.
